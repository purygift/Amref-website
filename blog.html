                            <p class="m-0">Diabetes is a chronic condition marked by high blood sugar levels due to insufficient insulin production or ineffective insulin use. There are three main types: Type 1, Type 2, and gestational diabetes, each with distinct characteristics. Symptoms include increased thirst, frequent urination, weight loss, fatigue, and blurred vision. Managing diabetes involves a healthy diet, regular exercise, weight management, and monitoring blood sugar levels, with medication or insulin therapy as needed. At Kibera Community Health Center, we provide comprehensive care and support to help individuals manage their diabetes and lead healthy lives.</p>

                            <a class="h3 d-block mb-3" href="">What is Cervical Cancer?</a>
                            <p class="m-0">Cervical cancer, a preventable yet serious disease, remains a significant health concern, especially in underserved communities. It primarily develops in the cells lining the cervix, the lower part of the uterus, and is most often caused by persistent infection with certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV), a common sexually transmitted infection. <br><br>While HPV infection is common, not all women with HPV will develop cervical cancer, but certain risk factors such as smoking, a weakened immune system, and lack of regular screenings can increase the risk.

                               <br><br> Regular screenings like Pap smears and HPV tests are crucial for early detection, as cervical cancer often shows no symptoms in its early stages. Early detection can lead to effective treatment and higher chances of survival. Additionally, vaccination against HPV is another critical preventive measure, ideally administered before individuals become sexually active, to protect against the most common cancer-causing HPV strains.
                            <br><br>At Kibera Community Health Center, we emphasize the importance of regular screenings and HPV vaccinations. Our dedicated team provides education, screenings, and vaccinations to women in our community, aiming to detect cervical abnormalities early and prevent the development of cervical cancer. By raising awareness, offering accessible healthcare services, and promoting preventive measures, we strive to protect women’s health and reduce the incidence of cervical cancer in our community.</p>

The immunization schedule typically starts shortly after birth and continues through childhood, with vaccines recommended at specific intervals to provide immunity when children are most vulnerable.<br><br>

                                Birth: The first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine is administered shortly after birth to protect against hepatitis B virus infection.
                                
                                <br><br>2 months: The first set of routine vaccinations begins, including vaccines against diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), polio, and pneumococcal disease.
                                
                                <br><br> 4 months: The second set of routine vaccinations, including boosters for the vaccines administered at 2 months, is administered to further strengthen immunity.
                                
                                <br><br> 6 months: Additional doses of vaccines are administered, including the third dose of hepatitis B vaccine and boosters for vaccines administered at 2 and 4 months.
                                
                                <br><br>12 months: The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and the varicella (chickenpox) vaccine are typically administered at 12 months to protect against these contagious diseases.
                                
                                <br><br>15 months: Additional doses of routine vaccines, including boosters for vaccines administered at earlier ages, are administered to maintain immunity.
                                
                                <br><br>18 months: Depending on the specific immunization schedule followed, additional vaccines such as the hepatitis A vaccine may be administered at 18 months.
                                
                                <br><br> 4-6 years: Booster doses of certain vaccines, such as the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTaP) vaccine, the polio vaccine, and the MMR vaccine, may be administered before starting school.

                            <p class="m-0">Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant global health challenge, particularly in communities with limited access to healthcare resources. It is caused by bacteria called Mycobacterium tuberculosis and primarily affects the lungs but can also affect other parts of the body. TB is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, making it highly contagious. Common symptoms include coughing, chest pain, fever, weight loss, and fatigue. <br>

                                <br>At Kibera Community Health Center, we are committed to tackling TB through our Comprehensive Care Unit (CCC), which provides specialized care and support for TB patients. Our services include early detection through TB screening, diagnosis through sputum tests and chest X-rays, and treatment with a combination of antibiotics over several months. We also offer education and support to prevent the spread of TB within the community.
                                
                               <br> <br>In addition to TB treatment, we recognize the importance of addressing factors that contribute to TB transmission, such as poverty, malnutrition, and overcrowded living conditions. Therefore, our approach involves holistic care, including nutritional support, social services, and community outreach programs aimed at raising awareness and reducing TB stigma.
                                
                                <br><br>By providing comprehensive TB care and addressing the underlying social determinants, we aim to combat TB effectively and improve the health outcomes of individuals and families in our community. Together, we can work towards a TB-free future for Kibera.</p>
